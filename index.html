                                        First, I refer many Python scripts about crawling stock data from Taiwan Stock Exchange website and create one for my own purpose. Then I compute the stock data according to the insights. <br/>
                                        After, I sign up for a linebot account and activate messaging API and bind it with my Heroku App. I find it very interesting to create a bot in a short time that can interactive with people.

First, we reduce the problem from MAPF to the integer multi-commodity flow problem and reduce the integer multi-commodity flow problem to multi-agent routing problem in polynomial time. Then, we solve the multi-agent routing problem by a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, Q-learning, and a variant of Q-learning that only uses a bounded number of actions in the learning process.
